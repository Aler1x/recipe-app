# Recipe app

## Setup

We develop for android so you need to download and install [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

You also need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

After that, you can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

We use npm, please not use other package manager. It can cause some issues and we don't want that.

## Run

To run the app, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Now you can use the QR code to run the app on your phone or use the emulator.

## Gitflow
